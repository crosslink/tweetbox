TweetBox is the name for an open source, JavaFX based Twitter desktop client. There exists another twitter application that goes by this name, so on twitter, the JavaFX TweetBox is registered as "tweetbox.fx". There also exists a twitter account named "tweetbox" which is not associated with tweetbox.fx, but with a tweeting jukebox of some sorts.

The TweetBox project can be easily found on the web through http://tweetbox.org

The stable (or better: non-development) version can be launched through this url: http://webstart.tweetbox.org
